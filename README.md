# RoboSpace

Web-based robot simulation and RL training platform

---

## 🚀 Overview

RoboSpace is a full-stack, cloud-hosted platform that makes it as easy to train robots in simulation as it is to test ML models on Hugging Face or build apps on Replit.  Users can upload their own robot model (URDF, MJCF, or GLTF), pick from a library of environments, configure a reinforcement-learning algorithm (PPO, SAC, DDPG, etc.), and hit **Train**—all from the browser.  No local installs, no GPU drivers, no ROS headaches.  Training runs in the cloud (MuJoCo WebAssembly, Unity WebGL, or headless servers) and streams live video, stats, and checkpoints back to your dashboard.

## 🎯 The Problem

- **Real-world training is slow & risky**  
  Wear-and-tear, safety resets, manual resets, downtime.  
- **Local sim requires heavy setup**  
  ROS, GPU drivers, OS quirks, version conflicts.  
- **Hard to scale & share**  
  Everyone’s local machine differs—results aren’t reproducible.  
- **No one-click cloud sim+RL**  
  Unlike Hugging Face for models or Replit for code, robotics still needs complex setup.

## 💡 Our Solution

RoboSpace streamlines the entire pipeline:

1. **Upload** your robot model (URDF / MJCF / GLTF).  
2. **Select** an environment (maze, room, terrain, warehouse, table-top).  
3. **Configure** the RL algorithm (PPO, SAC, DDPG via SB3 or RLlib).  
4. **Train** with a single click—watch live video, charts, and logs.  
5. **Download** policy weights or deploy directly to real-world hardware.

## 🧩 Key Features (MVP)

- ✅ **Custom Robot Upload** (URDF/MJCF)  
- ✅ **Curated Environments** (indoor, outdoor, obstacles)  
- ✅ **Algorithm Selection** (PPO, DDPG, SAC)  
- ✅ **Configurable Hyperparameters** (lr, batch size, reward shaping)  
- ✅ **Live Training Visualization** (WebGL/video + real-time charts)  
- ✅ **Checkpoint & Export** (download policy `.zip` / load existing)

## 🧑‍🔬 Example User Flow

1. Navigate to **robospace.ai**  
2. **Upload** `my_robot.urdf`  
3. **Select** “Obstacle Course” environment  
4. **Choose** PPO (SB3) algorithm  
5. **Set**  
   - Learning rate: `3e-4`  
   - Timesteps: `2e5`  
6. Click **Train**  
7. Watch live WebGL sim + reward curve  
8. **Export** policy weights (`my_policy.zip`) for real-world deployment

## 🔭 Future Extensions

- **Collaborative Sessions**: share runs, co-train (like Google Colab).  
- **Multi-agent Sim**: teams of robots, adversarial scenarios.  
- **Sim2Real Bridge**: upload real-world scans or camera data.  
- **Crowdsourced Rewards**: human-in-the-loop feedback.  
- **One-Click Deployment**: push policies to HomeOS-enabled robots.
